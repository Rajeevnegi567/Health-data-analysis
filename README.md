The Symptom-Based Disease Diagnosis App is a web-based application designed to predict diseases based on user-input symptoms. Built with Flask, it leverages a pre-trained Support Vector Classifier (SVC) model to deliver accurate predictions. The app features user-friendly pages for disease prediction, developer info, contact, and blogs.

🚀 Features
Disease Prediction: Users can input symptoms and receive a predicted diagnosis.
User Registration System: Allows users to register and log in for personalized features.
Informative Pages: About, Contact, Developer, and Blog sections for additional context.
Interactive Interface: Clean and responsive UI for seamless user experience.

🔧 Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
Backend: Flask (Python)
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (SVC Model)
Database: SQLite (for user registration and login)


📊 How It Works
Input Symptoms: Users select symptoms from a dropdown.
Prediction Engine: The SVC model processes the input.
Result Display: Predicted disease with confidence level is displayed.
